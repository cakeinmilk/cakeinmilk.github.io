STEWART LEE on DANIEL KITSON

Few serious fans of the form will deny that Kitson is the world;s greatest living stand-up, but he avoids all conventional documentation. While he is the master of the sort of narrative-driven, high-concept pieces he helped pioneer, he is also possessed of the charisma and-in-the-moment skills that could have made him a greater and more popular populist comedian than Michael McIntyre, Peter Kay, or Mrs Brown.
In the comedy community he even has his own adjective, "Kitsonesque", and the fact that you have never heard of him is irrelevant.
