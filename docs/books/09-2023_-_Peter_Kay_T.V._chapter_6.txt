I cast two other stand-ups in the episode. Jo Enright is one of the passengers on the seventies coach trip, and Daniel Kitson, who’s hilarious as Duncan Beech, a St John Ambulance man working at the arena. I’d always talk to them when I was working as a steward so had a bit of an insight on the type of person required. Daniel Kitson is without a doubt one of the most gifted comedians I’ve ever met. He’s definitely got very funny bones and can make you laugh without doing very much at all.
