The other shows that were nominated were Adam Hills, Phil Nichol, Noel Fielding, Omid Djalili and Daniel Kitson, who won that year. Everyone was pleased. Daniel is a comic’s comic, everybody liked him. Plot a graph and put funny on one axis and ambition on the other. Daniel is in the sweet spot, super funny and with zero ambition (commercially, that is – creatively, he’s a very ambitious boy). Daniel doesn’t want to be on television or in films, doesn’t want a Netflix special. He’s happy being super funny and not taking bread from anyone’s table. Great.
